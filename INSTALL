Install the package automatically using

$ cpanm Photonic

Otherwise you can download the package and unpack it to any directory,
change to it and give the commands:

  $ perl Build.PL
  $ ./Build
  $ ./Build test
  $ ./Build install

Alternatively you may try

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install


Note: You may need to install some prerequisites by hand. For example,
PDL::FFTW3 requires that the library libfftw3 be installed (packages
fftw3 and fftw3-dev under Debian) and Alien::FFTW3 or pkg-config.
