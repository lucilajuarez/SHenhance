=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Photonic::LE::NP::OneH;
    my $nr=Photonic::LE::NP::OneH->new(epsilon=>$epsilon,
           geometry=>$geometry);

    say $nr->next_b2;
    my $state=$nr->nextState;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements calculation of Haydock coefficients and Haydock states for
the calculation of the non retarded dielectric function of arbitrary
periodic many component systems in arbitrary number of dimentions. One
Haydock coefficient at a time. The starting state is homogenous.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(epsilon=>$e, geometry=>$g[, smallH=>$s])

Create a new Ph::NR::NP::OneH object with GeometryG0 $g, dielectric
function $e and optional smallness parameter  $s.

=back

=head1 ACCESORS (read only)

=over 4

=item * epsilon

A PDL::Complex PDL giving the value of the dielectric function epsilon
for each pixel of the system

=item * geometry Photonic::Types::GeometryG0

A Photonic::Geometry object defining the geometry of the system,
the charateristic function and the direction of the G=0 vector. Should
be given in the initializer.

=item * B dims r G GNorm L scale f

Accesors handled by geometry (see Photonic::Geometry)

=item * smallH

A small number used as tolerance to end the iteration. Small negative
b^2 coefficients are taken to be zero. Handled by Photonic::Roles::EpsParams

=item * previousState currentState nextState

The n-1-th, n-th and n+1-th Haydock states; a complex number for each pixel

=item * current_a

The n-th Haydock coefficient a

=item * current_b2 next_b2 current_b next_b

The n-th and n+1-th b^2 and b Haydock coefficients

=item * iteration

Number of completed iterations

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * iterate

Performs a single Haydock iteration and updates current_a, next_state,
next_b2, next_b, shifting the current values where necessary. Returns
0 when unable to continue iterating.
