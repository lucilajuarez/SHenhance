=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Photonic::LE::S::EpsL;
   my $eps=Photonic::LE::S::EpsL->new(nr=>$nr, nh=>$nh);
   my $epsilonLongitudinal=$eps->epsL;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the longitudinal dielectric function for a given fixed
Photonic::LE::S::AllH structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(nr=>$nr, nh=>$nh, smallE=>$smallE)

Initializes the structure.

$nr is a Photonic::LE::S::AllH structure (required).

$nh is the maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use (required).

$smallE is the criteria of convergence for the continued fraction
(defaults to 1e-7)

=back

=head1 ACCESORS (read only)

=over 4

=item * epsL

The longitudinal macroscopic function.

=item * nr

The NonRetarded::LE::S::AllH structure

=item * nh

The maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use.

=item * nhActual

The actual number of Haydock coefficients used in the last calculation

=item * converged

Flags that the last calculation converged before using up all coefficients

=item * smallE

Criteria of convergence for continued fraction. 0 means don't
check. From Photonic::Roles::EpsParams
