=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Photonic::WE::S::EpsilonP;
   my $eps=Photonic::WE::S::EpsilonP->new(haydock=>$h, nh=>$nh);
   my $EpsTensor=$W->evaluate($epsB);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the macroscopic dielectric tensor component for a given fixed
Photonic::WE::S::AllH structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components.

NOTE: Only works for polarizations along principal directions.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(haydock=>$h, nh=>$nh, smallE=>$smallE)

Initializes the structure.

$h Photonic::WE::S::AllH describing the structure and some parametres.

$nh is the maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use.

$smallE is the criterium of convergence (default 1e-7) for
Haydock coefficients and for the continued fraction. From
Photonic::Roles::EpsParams.

$k is a flag to keep states in Haydock calculations (default 0)

=item * evaluate($epsB)

Returns the macroscopic dielectric component for a given value of the
dielectric function of the particle $epsB. The host's
response $epsA is taken from the AllH structure.

NOTE: Only works along principal directions.
