=head1 DESCRIPTION

Iterates the calculation of Haydock coefficients and states in the
retarded regime and saves them for later retrieval.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(metric=>$m, polarization=>$p, nh=>$nh[, keepStates=>$k, smallH=>$s])

Initializes an Ph::WE::R2::AllH object. $m is the retarded metric to use,
$p is the polarization of the field, $nh is the maximum number of desired
coefficients to calculate, $k is a flag, non zero to save the Haydock
states, $s is a number to be considered negligible. Other arguments
are as in Photonic::WE::R2::OneH.

=item * run

Runs the iteration to completion

=item * All the Photonic::WE::R2::OneH methods

=back

=head1 ACCESORS (read only)

=over 4

=item * nh

Maximum number of desired Haydock 'a' coefficients and states. The
number of b coefficients is one less.

=item * keepStates

Flag to keep (1) or discard (0) Haydock states

=item * states

Array of Haydock states

=item * as

Array of Haydock a coefficients

=item * bs

Array of Haydock b coefficients

=item * b2s

Array of Haydock b coefficients squared

=item * cs

Array of Haydock c coefficients

=item * bcs

Array of Haydock b times c coefficients

=item * gs

Array of Haydock g coefficients

=item * All the Photonic::WE::R2::OneH methods
