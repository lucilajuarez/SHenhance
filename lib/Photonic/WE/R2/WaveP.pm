=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Photonic::WE::R2::WaveP;
   my $W=Photonic::WE::R2::WaveP->new(haydock=>$h, nh=>$nh, smallE=>$s);
   my $WaveProjection=$W->evaluate($epsB);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the macroscopic projected wave operator for a given fixed
Photonic::WE::R2::AllH structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components.

NOTE: Only works along principal directions, as it treats Green's
function as scalar.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(haydock=>$h, nh=>$nh, smallE=>$smallE)

Initializes the structure.

$h is Photonic::WE::R2::AllH structure (required).

$nh is the maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use (required).

$smallE is the criteria of convergence (default 1e-7).

=item * evaluate($epsB)

Returns the macroscopic wave operator for a given value of the
dielectric functions of the particle $epsB. The host's
response $epsA is taken from the metric.
