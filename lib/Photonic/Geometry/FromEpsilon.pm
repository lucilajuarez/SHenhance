=head1 NAME

Photonic::Geometry::FromB

=head1 VERSION

version 0.011

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Photonic::Geometry::FromB;
     $g=Photonic::Geometry::FromB->new(B=>$pdl);
     $B=$g->B;
     $G=$g->G;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Create a geometry object to be used in a Photonic
calculation from a characteristic function.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(B=>$pdl[, L=>$L])

Creates a new Ph::G::FromB object

$pdl is a boolean array with 1's and 0's representing the characteriztic
function within the unit cell. Its dimensions must be odd. Its number
of dimensions is the dimension of space

$L is the size of the unit cell along the cartesian axes. By
default, it is the number of pixels.

=back

=head1 ACCESORS (read only)

=over 4

=item * B

The characteristic function as PDL

=item * L

Unit cell sizes as a B->ndims pdl.
